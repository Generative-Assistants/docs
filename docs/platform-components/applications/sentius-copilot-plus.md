# Sentius Copilot+

Sentius Copilot+ is an Electron-based desktop application that controls web browsers (and, later, desktop apps) across Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. Practically speaking, Sentius Copilot+ hosts a part of the **browser agent** that connects to a web browser on your computer, Google Chrome by default.

Sentius Copilot+ application can run in two modes:

* manual mode
* unattended mode

# Logging in

To log into Sentius Copilot+ application, you need to have a Google or Microsoft Account. It can be either a personal or a work-issued one.

# Running

## Manual Mode

You can interact with Sentius Copilot+ application manually by:

* asking it to perform new tasks for you
* showing it how to do tasks for you by recording and saving instructions for them in it
* asking it to perform tasks based on the saved instructions

## Unattended Mode

You can integrate your Sentius Copilot+ application to execute browser automation tasks into your existing application by obtaining your API key and using it to call [Browser Agent API](../api/browser-agent-api.md).
