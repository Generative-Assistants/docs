# Platform Components

Sentius **agentic platform** has three components that make it easy to build autonomous agents and complex workflows:

## Applications
* [Sentius Copilot+](applications/sentius-copilot-plus.md) - Electron-based desktop application that controls web browsers (and, later, desktop apps) across Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu.

* [Sentius Studio](applications/sentius-studio.md) - native desktop application that allows creation, editing, testing, deployment, and monitoring of complex workflows. Currently supports Windows 10+, with macOS support coming later in 2025.

## Services
* [Sentius Workflow Engine](services/workflow-engine.md) - agentic workflow engine designed to run complex multi-agent workflows. It is embedded into **Sentius Studio** and is also hosted in **Sentius Agentic Cloud**.
