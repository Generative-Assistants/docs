# Sentius Docs

## Development
Docs are built using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Install the package
```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Test docs site locally
```shell
mkdocs serve
```

Updates are automatically picked up, built, and deployed when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
